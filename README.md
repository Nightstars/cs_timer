 1.    INTRODUCTION
 
This project is a guide program on how to use the console to perform timing tasks

on the .net core platform, so that the development tasks that require this

business need do not need to focus on the realization of timing tasks, but pay 

more attention to actual business functions. This project supports configuration 

Files, allowing dynamic adjustment of the timing point after the version is 

released, temporarily only supports daily timing, which can be accurate to the 

second level.
